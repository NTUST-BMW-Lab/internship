# Log analytics with Generative AI Summary

The article discusses how Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can transform log analytics by automating the analysis of large volumes of log data. Traditional log analytics tools often struggle with the sheer volume and unstructured nature of logs. Generative AI models, like GPT, can interpret these logs, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights, making it easier for teams to diagnose issues and improve system performance.

## 1. Problem
  The main problem discussed in the article is the challenge of handling vast, unstructured log data with traditional log analytics tools. These tools often struggle with:
  - The sheer volume of logs.
  - Complexity in identifying patterns and anomalies.
  - Inefficiencies in manual log analysis, leading to delays in diagnosing and resolving issues.

## 2. Contribution of the Paper
  The article highlights the contribution of Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in transforming log analytics. Key contributions include:
  - Introducing automation in log analysis to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
  - Enhancing the ability to detect anomalies, correlate events, and provide actionable insights.
  - Improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosing system issues through AI-driven insights.

## 3. System Architecture & Basic Concept of the Proposed Method & Performance Metrics:
  ### System Architecture & Basic Concept:
  - The method involves integrating Generative AI models like GPT into log analysis workflows.

# OAI Logging Facilities

## Overview
The OAI (Open Air Interface) logging facility is an essential component of the Open Air Interface project, designed to provide detailed logs for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the performance of the OAI software. Understanding how to effectively use and interpret these logs is crucial for diagnosing issues and ensuring optimal operation.

## Key Components
  ### 1. Logging Levels
  OAI uses various logging levels to categorize the importance and verbosity of log messages:
  * DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.
  * INFO: General information about the system's operation.
  * WARN: Indications of potential issues or important situations.
  * ERROR: Critical problems that require immediate attention.
  * FATAL: Severe errors leading to application termination.

  ### 2. Loggers and Contexts
  - Loggers: Each component or module in OAI has its own logger, which can be independently configured.
  - Contexts: Log messages often include context information, such as function names, file names, and line numbers, to help pinpoint the source of an issue.

  ### 3. Configuration
  The logging behavior can be configured through various means:
      - Log Level Configuration: Set globally or per module to control verbosity.
      - Log Output: Logs can be directed to console, files, or remote logging services.
      - Log Formatting: Customize the format to include timestamps, context, and message details.

# OAI Logging Facilities

## Overview
The OAI (Open Air Interface) logging facility is an essential component of the Open Air Interface project, designed to provide detailed logs for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the performance of the OAI software. Understanding how to effectively use and interpret these logs is crucial for diagnosing issues and ensuring optimal operation.

## Key Components
  1. Logging Levels
  OAI uses various logging levels to categorize the importance and verbosity of log messages:
  * DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.
  * INFO: General information about the system's operation.
  * WARN: Indications of potential issues or important situations.
  * ERROR: Critical problems that require immediate attention.
  * FATAL: Severe errors leading to application termination.
